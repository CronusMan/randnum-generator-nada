## Simple programm build on python using nada, to get random number in given range

Check nillion docs to see how to work with nada https://docs.nillion.com/quickstart-nada

To build app
```
nada build
```
Run tests

Note: It's epxected to all tests fail, cause app returning random value and we cannot expect it (if you just  dont guess it)

```
nada run randnum_test1
```
```
nada run randnum_test2
```
```
nada run randnum_test3
```
